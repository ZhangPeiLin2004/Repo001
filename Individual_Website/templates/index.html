            <h2>Why Household Energy Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Household energy consumption is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
                playing a crucial role in climate change. Residential energy use accounts for approximately 17% of 
                global CO₂ emissions when considering both direct energy use (e.g., heating, cooling, and electricity) 
                and indirect emissions from the production of goods and services consumed by households (IEA, 2021). 
                As urbanization and living standards rise, household energy demand is expected to grow, making sustainable 
                energy practices essential for mitigating climate change.
